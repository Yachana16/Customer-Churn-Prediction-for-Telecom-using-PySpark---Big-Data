# Customer-Churn-Prediction-for-Telecom-using-PySpark---Big-Data
In this project, we utilized PySpark to  analyze a large dataset and build a predictive model for customer churn. The choice of PySpark  was driven by its ability to efficiently process large datasets and its compatibility with machine  learning libraries. 
Customer churn, the phenomenon of customers discontinuing their services, is a significant 
concern in the telecom industry. Understanding the factors contributing to churn can help 
organizations implement proactive retention strategies. This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a telecom company using a dataset that 
contains various customer features. We employed PySpark, a powerful framework for large
scale data processing, to implement a logistic regression model for churn prediction. The 
dataset, "telecom_churn_final_data.csv," comprises key attributes such as customer 
demographics, tenure, payment methods, and service usage. The model achieved an Area 
Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.895 and an accuracy of 81.82%. Visualizations were created 
to analyze actual versus predicted churn values, the distribution of monthly charges, churn rates 
by contract and payment types, and a correlation heatmap of features. These insights can assist 
telecom companies in devising strategies to retain at-risk customers, thereby enhancing 
customer satisfaction and profitability. This report outlines the methodologies, results, and 
discussions surrounding the customer churn prediction project, demonstrating the effectiveness 
of PySpark in handling big data analytics.
